# Iris_dataset-kNN

Computation of Iris Dataset using kNN algorithm 

The datasets for iris and the k-nearest neighbour classifier has been imported from the famous **Scikit-learn** library.

The algorithm finds the euclidean distance between the input points and dataset points and makes predictions as to which species will the input value lie in. 

Categorises the input parameters _( Sepal length,width   Petal length,width )_ into the corresponding species **( Setosa, Versicolor and Virginica )**
